# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use D3, Leaflet, JavaScript, and HTML to create an interactive map. The map displays live earthquake data from the USGS ([data source](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)) as well as tectonic plate lines ([data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)) with the ability for the user to toggle the plates and earthquakes on or off. Further, there is an added display layer of major earthquakes (4.5 +) which the user may toggle on or off. Finally, there are 3 map layers available to toggle, one of which is a pretty cool "pencil" map layer.
